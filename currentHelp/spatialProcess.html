<h2>
Estimates a spatial process model. 

</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>For a given covariance function estimates the nugget (sigma^2) and process variance (rho)  and the
range parameter (theta) by restricted maximum likelihood and then computes the 
spatial model with these estimated parameters.
Other parameters of the covariance 
are kept fixed and need to be specified.  

</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function makes many choices for the user in terms of defaults and it is 
important to be aware of these. 
The spatial model is 
</p>
<p>Y.k= P(x.k) + Z(x.k)%*%d2 + g(x.k) + e.k
</p>
<p>where &quot;.k&quot; means subscripted by k, Y.k is the dependent variable
observed at location x.k. P is a low degree polynomial (default is a
linear function in the spatial coordinates) and Z is a matrix of covariates (optional) that enter as a linear model the fixed part. g is a mean zero,
Gaussian stochastic process with a marginal variance of rho and a
scale (or range) parameter, theta. The measurement errors, e.k, are
assumed to be uncorrelated, normally distributed with mean zero and
standard deviation sigma. If weights are supplied then the variance of e is assumed to be  <code>sigma^2/ weights</code>.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important aspect of this  function is that
the range (theta), nugget (sigma**2) and process variance (rho) parameters
for the covariance are estimated by restricted maximum
likelihood and this is the model that is then  used for spatial
prediction. Geostatistics usaually refers to sigma**2 + rho as the 
&quot;sill&quot; and often these parameters are estimated by variogram fitting rather
than maximum likelihood. To be consistent with spline models and to focus
on the key part of model we reparametrize as lambda= sigma**2/
rho and rho. Thinking about h as the spatial signal and e as the noise lambda
can be interpreted  as the noise to signal variance ratio in this spatial
context.(See the comparision with fitting the geoR model in the
examples section.)
</p>
<p>The likelihood and the cross valdiation function
can be concentrated to only depend on lambda and theta and so
in reported the optimiztation of these two criterion we focus
on this form of the parameters.  Once lambda and theta are
found, the MLE for rho has a closed form and of course then
sigma is then determined from lambda and rho. 
</p>
<p>Often the lambda
parameter is difficult to interpret when covariates and a
linear function of the coordinates is included and also when
the range becomes large relative to the size of the spatial
domain. For this reason it is convenient to report the
effective degrees of freedom (also referred to trA in R code and
the output summaries) associated with the predicted
surface or curve. This measure has a one to one relationship
with lamdba and is easier to interpret. For example an eff
degrees of freedom that is very small suggests that the
surface is rwell represented by a low ordoer
polynomial. Degrees of freedom close to the number of
locations indicates a surface that is close to interpolating
the observations and suggests a small or zero value for the
nugget variance.
</p>
<p>The default covariance model is assumed to follow a Matern
with smoothness set to 1.0.  This is implementd using the
<code>stationary.cov</code> covariance that can take a argument for
the form of the covariance, a sill and range parameters and
possibily additional parameter might comtrol the shape.
</p>
<p>See the example below how to switch to another model. (Note
that the exponential is also part of the Matern family with
smoothness set to .5. )
</p>
<p>The parameter estimation is done by <code>MLESpatialProcess</code>
and the returned list from this function is added to the Krig
output object that is returned by this function. The estimate
is a version of maximum likelihood where the observations are
transfromed to remove the fixed linear part of the model.  If
the user just wants to fix the range parameter theta then
<code>Krig</code> can be used.
</p>
<p>NOTE: The defaults for the <code>optim</code> function used in MLESpatialProcess are:
</p>
<pre>
  list(method = "BFGS", 
       control=list(fnscale = -1,
                      ndeps = rep(log(1.1),length(cov.params.start)+1), 
                     abstol = abstol,
                      maxit = 20))
</pre>
<p>There is always a hazard in providing a simple to use method that
makes many default choices for the spatial model. As in any analysis
be aware of these choices and try alternative models and parameter
values to assess the robustness of your conclusions. Also examine the
residuals to check the adequacy of the fit. See the examples below for
some help in how to do this easily in fields. Also see quilt.plot to
get an quick plot of a spatial field  to discern obvious spatial paterns.
</p>
<p><strong>summary</strong> method forms a list with class <code>spatialProcessSummary</code> that hasa subset of information from the output object and also creates a table of the estimates of the linear parameters in the fixed part of the model.
With replacated fields there is an option to estimate different linear parameters for each field
( <code> collapseFixedEffect = FALSE </code> ) and in this case a table is not created because there is more than one estimate. See (<code>Omega</code> and <code>fixedEffectsCov</code>) in the <code>mKrig</code> object to build the standard errors.
</p>
<p><strong>plot</strong> method  provides a panel of 4 diagnositic plots of the fit. 
Use <code>set.panel(2,2)</code> to see all 4 at once. The third plot gives the likelihood and
GCV functions as a function of lambda evaluated at the global MLE for theta.
This is based on the gird evaluations in the component MLEInfo$MLEProfileLambda.
The fourth
plot is a profile likelihood trace for theta  having maximized over lambda and is based on the component MLEInfo$MLEGrid. 
</p>
<p><strong>print</strong> method prints the  <code>spatialProcessSummary</code> object of the fit, adding some details and explanations.
</p>



<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of classes <code>mKrig</code> and  <code>SpatialProcess</code>. The main difference
from mKrig is an extra component, <code>MLEInfo</code> that has the results of the profile likelihood grid
evaluation over theta ( having maximizing lamdba), joint maximization over theta and lambda,
and a grid evaluation over lambda with theta fixed at its MLE.
