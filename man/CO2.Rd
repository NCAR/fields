\title{Simulated global CO2 observations}
\description{
 This is an example of moderately large spatial data set and consists of 
simulated CO2 concentrations that are irregularly sampled from a lon/lat 
grid. Also included is the complete CO2 field  (CO2.true) used to generate the 
synthetic observations.}
 \usage{data(CO2)  }
\format{
  The format of \code{CO2} is a list with two components:
\itemize{
\item lon.lat: 26633x2 matrix of the longitude/latitude locations. 
 These are a subset of  a larger lon/lat grid (see example below).
\item y:   26633 CO2 concentrations in parts per million.
}
 The format of \code{CO2.true}
 is a list in  "image" format with components:
\itemize{
 \item x longitude grid values.
 \item y latitude grid values.
 \item z an image matrix with CO2 concentration in parts per million
 \item mask a logical image that indicates with grid locations were 
selected for the synthetic data set \code{CO2}.
}

}
\details{ 
This data was generously provided by Dorit Hammerling and Randy Kawa as a 
test example for the spatial analysis of remotely sensed (i.e. 
satellite) and irregular observations. The synthetic data is based on a 
true CO2 field simulated from a geophysical, numerical model.
