\details{
MODEL: The assumed model is Y.k=f(x.k) +e.k where e.k should be
approximately
normal and independent errors with variances sigma**2/w.k

ESTIMATE: A smoothing spline is a locally weighted average of the y's
based 
on the relative locations of the x values. Formally the estimate is 
the curve that minimizes the criterion: 

    
(1/n) sum(k=1,n) w.k( Y.k - f( X.k))**2  + lambda R(f) 

where R(f) is the integral of the squared second derivative of f over 
the range of the X values. Because of the inclusion of the (1/n) in the
sum of squares the lambda parameter in sreg corresponds to the a value of
lambda*n in the Tps function and in the Krig function. 
 
 The solution to this minimization is a piecewise cubic polynomial with
the join points at the unique set of X values. The polynomial segments
are constructed so that the entire curve has continuous first and second
derivatives and the second and third derivatives are zero at the
boundaries.  The smoothing has the range [0,infinity]. Lambda equal to
zero gives a cubic spline interpolation of the data. As lambda diverges
to infinity ( e.g lambda =1e20) the estimate will converge to the
straight line estimated by least squares.

    The values of the estimated function at the data points can be
expressed in the matrix form:
  
    predicted values= A(lambda)Y 

where A is an nXn symmetric matrix that does NOT depend on Y. 
The diagonal elements are the leverage values for the estimate and the 
sum of these  (trace(A(lambda)) can be interpreted as the effective 
number of parameters that are used to define the spline function. 
IF there are replicate points the A matrix is the result of finding group
averages and applying a weighted spline to the means. 
The A matrix is also used to find "Bayesian" confidence intervals for the 
estimate, see the example below. 

CROSS-VALIDATION:The GCV criterion with no replicate points for a fixed
value of lambda is

 (1/n)(Residual sum of squares)/((1-(tr(A)-offset)*cost + offset)/n)**2, 

Usually offset =0 and cost =1. Variations on GCV with replicate points are
described in the documentation help file for Krig.  With an appropriate
choice for the smoothing parameter, the estimate of sigma**2 is found by
(Residual sum of squares)/tr(A).

COMPUTATIONS: The computations for 1-d splines exploit the banded
structure of the matrices needed to solve for the spline coefficients.
Banded structure also makes it possible to get the diagonal elements of A
quickly. This approach is different from the algorithms in Tps and
tremendously more efficient for larger numbers of unique x values ( say >
200). The advantage of Tps is getting "Bayesian" standard errors at
predictions different from the observed x values. This function is similar
to the S-Plus smooth.spline. The main advantages are more information and
control over the choice of lambda and also the FORTRAN source code is
available (css.f). 

See also the function \code{splint} which is designed to be a bare bones
but fast smoothing spline.
