<h2>
Kriging surface estimate  
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Fits a surface to irregularly spaced data. The Kriging model assumes  
that the unknown  function is a realization  of a Gaussian 
random spatial processes. The assumed model is additive 
Y = P(x) +  Z(X) + e, where P is a low order polynomial and Z is a 
mean zero, 
Gaussian stochastic process with a  
covariance that is unknown up to a scale constant. The main advantages of
this function are the flexibility in specifying the covariance as an
R language function and also the supporting functions plot, predict,
predictSE, surface for
subsequent analysis. Krig also supports a correlation model where the mean
and marginal variances are supplied.

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>chol.args</code></td>
<td>

<p>Arguments to be passed to the cholesky decomposition in Krig.engine.fixed. 
The default if NULL, assigned at the top level of this function, is 
list( pivot=FALSE). This argument is useful when working with 
the sparse matrix package. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>cov.args</code></td>
<td>

<p>A list with the arguments to call the covariance function. (in addition to the locations)
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>cov.function</code></td>
<td>

<p>Covariance function for data in the form of an R function (see 
Exp.simple.cov as an example).  
Default assumes that correlation is an exponential function of distance.
See also <code>stationary.cov</code> for more general choice of covariance 
shapes. <code>exponential.cov</code> will be faster if only the exponential 
covariance form is needed. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>cost</code></td>
<td>

<p>Cost value used in GCV criterion. Corresponds to a penalty for  
increased number of parameters. The default is 1.0 and corresponds to the
usual GCV function. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>df</code></td>
<td>

<p>The effective number of parameters for the fitted surface. Conversely, 
N- df, where N is the total number of observations is the degrees of
freedom associated with the residuals. 
This is an alternative to specifying lambda and much more interpretable.
NOTE: GCV argument defaults to TRUE if this argument is used.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>GCV</code></td>
<td>
<p> If TRUE matrix decompositions are done to allow estimating 
lambda by GCV or REML and specifying smoothness by the effective degrees of
freedom. So the GCV switch does more than just supply a GCV estimate. Also if
lambda or df are passed the estimate will be evaluated at those values, 
not at the GCV/REML estimates of lambda. 
If FALSE Kriging  estimate is found under a fixed lambda model. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>give.warnings</code></td>
<td>
<p> If TRUE warnings are given in gcv grid search limits.
If FALSE warnings are not given. Best to leave this TRUE!
This argument is set ot FALSE if warn is less than zero in the
top level, R  options function. See options()$warn</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>knots</code></td>
<td>

<p>A matrix of locations similar to x. These can define an alternative set of
basis functions for representing the estimate. One choice may be a
space-filling subset of the original x locations, thinning out the
design where locations cluster. The 
default is to put a &quot;knot&quot; at all unique locations. (See details.)
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>lambda</code></td>
<td>

<p>Smoothing parameter that is the ratio of the error variance (sigma**2) 
to the scale parameter of the  
covariance function (rho). If omitted this is estimated by GCV ( see
method below). 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>method</code></td>
<td>

<p>Determines what &quot;smoothing&quot; parameter should be used. The default 
is to estimate standard GCV 
Other choices are: GCV.model, GCV.one, RMSE, pure error and REML. The 
differences are explained below.  
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>mean.obj</code></td>
<td>

<p>Object to predict the mean of the spatial process. This used in when
fitting a correlation model with varying spatial means and varying
marginal variances. (See details.)
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>m</code></td>
<td>

<p>A polynomial function of degree (m-1) will be  
included in the model as the drift (or spatial trend) component. 
The &quot;m&quot; notation is from thin-plate splines where m is the 
derivative in the penalty function. With m=2 as the default a linear 
model in the locations  will be fit a fixed part of the model. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>na.rm</code></td>
<td>
<p>If TRUE NAs will be removed from the <code>y</code> vector and the 
corresponding rows of <code>x</code> &ndash; with a warning. 
If FALSE Krig will just stop with a message. Once NAs are removed all 
subsequent analysis in fields does not use those data. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>nstep.cv</code></td>
<td>
<p> Number of grid points for the coarse grid search to
minimize the GCV RMLE and other related criteria for finding lambda,
the smoothing parameter.  Default is 200, fairly large to avoid some
cases of closely spaced local minima. Evaluations of the GCV and
related objective functions are cheap given the matrix decompositions
described below.  </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>null.args</code></td>
<td>
<p> Extra arguments for the null space function
<code>null.function</code>.  If <code>fields.mkpoly</code> is passed as
<code>null.function</code> then this is set to a list with the value of
<code>m</code>. So the default is use a polynomial of degree m-1 for the
null space (fixed part) of the model.  </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>null.function</code></td>
<td>

<p>An R function that creates the matrices for the null space model.  
The default is fields.mkpoly, an R function that creates a polynomial 
regression matrix with all terms up to degree m-1. (See Details)  
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>offset</code></td>
<td>
<p> The offset to be used in the GCV criterion. Default is
0. This would be used when Krig is part of a backfitting algorithm and
the offset is other model degrees of freedom from other regression
components.  </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>rho</code></td>
<td>

<p>Scale factor for covariance. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>scale.type</code></td>
<td>

<p>This is a character string among: &quot;range&quot;, &quot;unit.sd&quot;, &quot;user&quot;, &quot;unscaled&quot;.
The independent variables and knots are scaled to the specified scale.type. 
By default no scaling is done. This usuall makes sense for spatial locations.
Scale type of &quot;range&quot; scales the data to the interval (0,1) by forming 
(x-min(x))/range(x) for each x. Scale type of &quot;unit.sd&quot; 
Scale type of &quot;user&quot; allows specification of an x.center and x.scale by the 
user. The default for &quot;user&quot; is mean 0 and standard deviation 1. Scale 
type of &quot;unscaled&quot; does not scale the data. 
</p>
</td></tr>

<td>

<p>Object to predict the marginal standard deviation of the spatial process. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>sigma2</code></td>

specified then the error variance is sigma2 divided by weights. 
Note that lambda is defined as the ratio  sigma2/rho.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>verbose</code></td>

<p>If true will print out all kinds of intermediate stuff. Default is false,
of course as this is used mainly for debugging.

error. The default is equal weighting i.e. vector of unit weights.

<td>

<p>An R function that creates a weights matrix to the observations.  
This is only needed if the weight matirx has off diagonal elements.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function produces a object of class Krig. With this object it is
easy to subsequently predict with this fitted surface, find standard
errors, alter the y data ( but not x), etc. 
</p>
<p>The Kriging model is: Y.k= f(x.k) = P(x.k) + Z(x.k) + e.k
</p>
<p>where &quot;.k&quot; means subscripted by k, Y is the dependent variable observed 
at location x.k, P is a low order polynomial, Z is a mean zero, Gaussian 
field with covariance function K and e is assumed to be independent 
normal errors. The estimated surface is the best linear unbiased 
estimate (BLUE) of f(x)= P(x) + Z(x) given the observed data. For this 
estimate K, is taken to be rho*cov.function and the errors have variance 
sigma**2. In more conventional geostatistical terms rho is the &quot;sill&quot; if 
the covariance function is actually a correlation function and sigma**2 
is the nugget variance or measure error variance (the two are confounded 
in this model.)  If the weights are given then the variance of e.k is 
sigma**2/ weights.k . In the case that the weights are specified as a 
matrix, W, using the wght.function option then the assumed covariance 
matrix for the errors is sigma**2 Wi, where Wi is the inverse of W. It 
is straightforward to show that the estimate of f only depends on sigma 
and rho through the ratio lambda = sigma**2/ rho. This parameter, termed 
the smoothing parameter plays a central role in the statistical 
computations within <code>Krig</code>. See also the help for thin plate 
splines, (<code>Tps</code>) to get another perspective on the smoothing 
parameter.
</p>
<p>This function also supports a modest extension of the Generalized 
Kriging model to include other covariates as fixed regression type 
components. In matrix form Y = Zb + F + E where Z is a matrix of 
covariates and b a fixed parameter vector, F the vector of function values at 
the observations and E a vector of errors. The The <code>Z</code> argument in 
the function is the way to specify this additional component.
</p>
<p>If the parameters rho and sigma2 are omitted in the call, then they are
estimated in the following way. If lambda is given, then sigma2 is
estimated from the residual sum of squares divided by the degrees of
freedom associated with the residuals.  Rho is found as the difference
between the sums of squares of the predicted values having subtracted off
the polynomial part and sigma2. These estimates are the MLE's under Gaussian 
assumptions on the process and errors. 
If lambda is also omitted is it estimated
from the data using a variety of approaches and then the values for sigma
and rho are found in the same way from the estimated lambda. 
</p>
<p>A useful extension of a stationary correlation to a nonstationary
covariance is what we term a correlation model. 
If mean and marginal standard deviation objects are included in the call.  
Then the observed data is standardized based on these functions.  The
spatial process is then estimated with respect to the standardized scale.
However for predictions and standard errors the mean and standard
deviation surfaces are used to produce results in the original scale of
the observations.
</p>
<p>The GCV function has several alternative definitions when replicate
observations are present or if one uses a reduced set knots.  Here are the
choices based on the method argument:  
</p>
<p>GCV: leave-one-out GCV. But if
there are replicates it is leave one group out. (Wendy and Doug prefer
this one.)  
</p>
<p>GCV.one: Really leave-one-out GCV even if there are replicate
points.  This what the old tps function used in FUNFITS.
</p>
<p>rmse: Match the estimate of sigma**2 to a external value ( called rmse)  
</p>
<p>pure error: Match the estimate of sigma**2 to the estimate based on
replicated data (pure error estimate in ANOVA language).  
</p>
<p>GCV.model:
Only considers the residual sums of squares explained by the basis
functions.  
</p>
<p>REML: 
The process and errors are assumed to the Gaussian and the likelihood is 
concentrated (or profiled) with respect to lambda. The MLE of lambda is 
found from this criterion. Restricted means that the likelihood is formed from a linear transformation  of the observations that is orthogonal to the 
column space of P(x). 
</p>
<p>WARNING: The covariance functions often have a nonlinear parameter(s) that
often control the strength of the correlations as a function of separation,
usually referred to as the range parameter. This parameter must be
specified in the call to Krig and will not be estimated. 
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A object of class Krig. This includes the predicted values in  
fitted.values and the residuals in residuals. The results of the grid 
search to minimize the generalized cross validation function are 
returned in gcv.grid. 
</p>
<p>The coef.Krig function only returns the coefficients, &quot;d&quot;, associated with the 
fixed part of the model (also known as the null space or spatial drift).
