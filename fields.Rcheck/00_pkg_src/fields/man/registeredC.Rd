\title{Information objects that register
C and FORTRAN functions.
}
\description{
These are objects of class \code{CallRoutine} or \code{FortranRoutine} and also \code{\link{NativeSymbolInfo}}
They provide information for compiledfunctions called with \code{.Call},
or \code{.Fortran}.
Ordinarily one would not need to consult these and they are used to make
the search among dynamically loaded libraries ( in particular the fields library) have less ambiguity and
also be faster. These are created when the package/library is loaded 
are have their definitions from the compliation of  \code{init.c} in the
package source (src) directory.

\format{
  The format is a list with components:
  \describe{
  \item{name}{The (registration ?) name of the C function.}
  \item{address}{See \link{NativeSymbolInfo}. }
  \item{dll}{Dynamically linked library information.}
  \item{numParameters}{Number of calling arguments in function.}
  }
  }
\details{
 \describe{
\item{addToDiagC}{ adds diagonal elements to a matrix. See code{mKrig}.}

\item{ExponentialUpperC}{Fills in upper triangle of a matrix with the exponential covariance function. See \code{ExponentialUpper}}

\item{compactToMatC}{ Converts compact format to full matrix format. See \code{compactToMat}.}

\item{multebC}{Mulitplies a vector/matrix with an exponential covariance function. See \code{exp.cov}} 

\item{multwendlandg}{This has been mysteriously included but it is not a function! }

\item{mltdrb}{Evaluates the derivatives of thin plate sline radial basis functions. See \code{rad.cov}. }

\item{RdistC}{ Euclidean distance function between sets of coordinates.
See \code{rdist}.}
}

See \code{package_native_routine_registration_skeleton} for the 
utility used to create these data objects.

It is not clear why these routines have been flagged as needing
documentation while other routines have not.
