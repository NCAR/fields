# spam 0.60-0

# spam 0.50-0

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

*  Using the flag 'structurebased=FALSE', the behavior of spam is now much, much closer to regular matrix calculations.
    This is illustrated when calculating gamma of a sparse matrix.
*  Along the same lines, the flag 'NAOK=TRUE' allows the use of the "not finite numbers" (NA, NaN, Inf).
    We have tested many, many functions but full fledged use is not yet guaranteed.
*  Currently, we can still guarantee backwards compatibility...

NEW FEATURES

*  New functions 'crossprod' and 'tcrossprod' as well as according method definitions.
*  New constructor functions 'rowpointers<-' etc.
*  Better option handling. The option 'safemode' is now 'safemodevalidity'. Additionally, new option 'NAOK'.

    ('Math2' inherently does).

# spam 0.40-0

BUG FIXES

    Thanks to Andrew Hong and Beat Briner for pointing out.
*  To simplify communication, we have switched increased the tenth version number.
*  All other changes are of cosmetic nature.


# spam 0.30-x

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

*  Added several plots to visualize several MCMC chains ('grid_trace2', 'grid_zoom', ...).

NEW FEATURES

    ('map.landkreis' is now obsolete).

*  Increased dependency to >= R 2.15.
*  Minor code and help cleanup.


# spam 0.29-0, 0.29-1, 0.29-2, 0.29-3

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

*  There is a generic conflict with 'backsolve' between spam and other packages (e.g., bdsmatrix).
   To avoid the issue, we use the standard generic implemented in 'methods' which requires an additional argument for version 0.29-0 (see also PR#14883).
    However to maintain backwards compatibility with packages that depend on spam, this was reverted in 0.29-1.
    Currently, this conflict is not properly solved.
    I propose  to load 'spam' first then the other packages, followed by manually calling:

  *    setMethod("backsolve","spam.chol.NgPeyton",backsolve.spam)
        setMethod("backsolve","spam",backsolve.spam)

    Stay tuned...

*  Calls like:
 
  *    mat <- diag.spam(4)
        diag(mat[-1, ]) <- 3
        diag.spam(mat[ , -1]) <-2

    now work. They are, however, somewhat inefficient.
    'toeplitz.spam' is to be prefered.
    Pointed out by Florian Gerber.

*  The Gibbs sampler in the demo article-jss-example2 contains several bugs, pointed out by Steve Geinitz and Andrea Riebler.
    I'll post an updated sampler in a future release.

NEW FEATURES

*  New functions 'rmvnorm.const', 'rmvnorm.prec.const' and 'rmvnorm.canonical.const' to draw constrained multivariate normal variates.
*  New functions 'precmat' (wrapper to), 'precmat.RW1', 'precmat.RW2', 'precmat.season', 'precmat.IGMRFreglat' and 'precmat.IGMRFirreglat' to create precision matrices for IGMRF.
*  New methods 'rowSums', 'colSums' and  'rowMeans', 'colMeans' for 'spam' objects.
*  New methods 'head' and 'tail' for 'spam' and 'spam.chol.NgPeyton' objects.
*  New method 'chol2inv' for 'spam' object.
*  New option 'inefficiencywarning': handling of warnings issued in case of an inefficient calculation. 
*  New option 'structurebased': should operations be performed on the nonzero entries or on including the zeros.
    Classical example: what should the cosine of a sparse matrix look like?
    In the near future, all operations from Math and Ops will include this option.
    Some loss of backwards compatibility might be lost in the future.

INTERNAL CHANGES

*  New much faster approach to extract rows. For not too sparse large matrices improvements over two orders of magnitudes are achieved.
*  Elininated '.Internal()' calls that induce a 'Note' on CRAN checks. This also implied a minor rewrite of 'image.spam'.
*  Minor code improvements.
*  Eliminated non-API calls (29.1).
*  Rewritten .C("bincode",...) call as suggested by Brian Ripley (29.2).

BUG FIXES
