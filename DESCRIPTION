Description: For curve, surface and function fitting with an emphasis
 on splines, spatial data and spatial statistics. The major methods
 include cubic, and thin plate splines, Kriging and compact
 covariances for large data sets. The splines and Kriging methods are
 supported by functions that can determine the smoothing parameter
 (nugget and sill variance) and other covariance parameters by cross
 validation and also by restricted maximum likelihood. For Kriging
 there is an easy to use function that also estimates the correlation
 scale (range).  A major feature is that any covariance function
 implemented in R and following a simple fields format can be used for
 spatial prediction. There are also many useful functions for plotting
 and working with spatial data as images. This package also contains
 an implementation of sparse matrix methods for large spatial data
 sets and currently requires the sparse matrix (spam) package. Use
 help(fields) to get started and for an overview.  The fields source
 code is deliberately commented and provides useful explanations of
 numerical details in addition to the manual pages. The commented
 source code can be viewed by expanding the source code file (ending in tar.gz)
 and looking in the R subdirectory. Please cite fields along with its
 DOI in your publications!
