<h2>
Thin plate spline regression 
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Fits a thin plate spline surface to irregularly spaced data. The 
smoothing parameter is chosen by generalized cross-validation. The assumed 
model is additive  Y = f(X) +e  where f(X) is a d dimensional surface. 
This function also works for just a single dimension  and is a special case of a spatial process estimate
(Kriging).  A &quot;fast&quot; version of this function uses a compactly supported Wendland covariance and computes the estimate for a fixed smoothing parameter.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
Tps(x, Y, m = NULL, p = NULL, scale.type = "range", lon.lat = FALSE,
         miles = TRUE, method = "GCV", GCV = TRUE, ...)

fastTps(x, Y, m = NULL, p = NULL,  theta, lon.lat=FALSE,
          find.trA = TRUE, lambda=0, ...)

</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>



<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>

<p>Matrix of independent variables. Each row is a location or a set of 
independent covariates. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>Y</code></td>
<td>

<p>Vector of dependent variables. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>m</code></td>
<td>

<p>A polynomial function of degree (m-1) will be  
included in the model as the drift (or spatial trend) component. 
Default is the value such that 2m-d is greater than zero where d is the 
dimension of x. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>p</code></td>
<td>

<p>Polynomial power for Wendland radial basis functions. Default is 2m-d 
where d is the dimension of x.  
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>scale.type</code></td>
<td>

<p>The independent variables and knots are scaled to the specified 
scale.type. 
By default the scale type is &quot;range&quot;, whereby 
the locations are transformed  
to the interval (0,1) by forming (x-min(x))/range(x) for each x. 
Scale type of &quot;user&quot; allows specification of an x.center and x.scale by 
the 
user. The default for &quot;user&quot; is mean 0 and standard deviation 1. Scale 
type of &quot;unscaled&quot; does not scale the data.  
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>theta</code></td>
<td>
<p>The tapering range that is passed to the Wendland compactly 
supported covariance. The covariance (i.e. the radial basis function) is 
zero beyond range theta. The larger theta the closer this model will approximate the 
standard thin plate spline.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>lon.lat</code></td>
<td>
<p>If TRUE locations are interpreted as lognitude and
latitude and great circle distance is used to find distances among
locations. The theta scale parameter for <code>fast.Tps</code> (setting the
compact support of the Wendland function) in this case is in units of
miles (see example and caution below). </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p> Determines what &quot;smoothing&quot; parameter should be
used. The default is to estimate standard GCV Other choices are:
GCV.model, GCV.one, RMSE, pure error and REML. The differences
are explained in the Krig help file.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>GCV</code></td>
<td>
<p>If TRUE the decompositions are done to efficiently evaluate the estimate, GCV function and likelihood at multiple values of lambda. </p>
</td></tr>    
<tr valign="top"><td><code>miles</code></td>
<td>
<p>If TRUE great circle distances are in miles if FALSE
distances are in kilometers</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>lambda</code></td>
<td>
<p>Smoothing parameter the ratio of error variance to
process variance, default is zero which corresponds to
interpolation. See fastTpsMLE to estimate this paramter
from the data.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>find.trA</code></td>
<td>
<p>If TRUE will estimate the effective degrees of freedom
using a simple Monte Carlo method. This will add to the computational
burden by approximately <code>NtrA</code> solutions of the linear system but
the cholesky decomposition is reused.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Both of these functions are special cases of using the 
<code>Krig</code> and <code>mKrig</code> functions. See the help on each of these
for more information on the calling arguments and what is returned. 
<code>Tps</code> makes use of the stable computations via eigen decompositions in <code>Krig</code>. <code>fastTps</code> follows the more standard computations for spatial statistics centered around the Cholesky decomposition in <code>mKrig</code>.
</p>
<p>A thin plate spline is the result of minimizing the residual sum of 
squares subject to a constraint that the function have a certain 
level of smoothness (or roughness penalty). Roughness is 
quantified by the integral of squared m-th order derivatives. For one 
dimension and m=2 the roughness penalty is the integrated square of 
the second derivative of the function. For two dimensions the 
roughness penalty is the integral of  
</p>
<p>(Dxx(f))**22 + 2(Dxy(f))**2 + (Dyy(f))**22 
</p>
<p>(where Duv denotes the second partial derivative with respect to u 
and v.) Besides controlling the order of the derivatives, the value of 
m also determines the base polynomial that is fit to the data. 
The degree of this polynomial is (m-1). 
</p>
<p>The smoothing parameter controls the amount that the data is 
smoothed. In the usual form this is denoted by lambda, the Lagrange 
multiplier of the minimization problem. Although this is an awkward 
scale, lambda =0 corresponds to no smoothness constraints and the data 
is interpolated.  lambda=infinity corresponds to just fitting the 
polynomial base model by ordinary least squares.  
</p>
<p>This estimator is implemented by passing the right generalized covariance
function based on radial basis functions to the more general function
Krig.  One advantage of this implementation is that once a Tps/Krig object
is created the estimator can be found rapidly for other data and smoothing
parameters provided the locations remain unchanged. This makes simulation
within R efficient (see example below). Tps does not currently support the
knots argument where one can use a reduced set of basis functions. This is
mainly to simplify the code and a good alternative using knots would be to use a
valid covariance from the Matern family and a large range parameter. 
</p>
<p>CAUTION about <code>lon.lat=TRUE</code>: The option to use great circle distance
to define the radial basis functions (<code>lon.lat=TRUE</code>) is very useful
for small geographic domains where the spherical geometry is well approximated by a plane. However, for large domains the spherical distortion be large enough that the basis function no longer define a positive definite system and Tps will report a numerical error. An alternative is to switch to a three
dimensional thin plate spline the locations being the direction cosines. This will 
give approximate great circle distances for locations that are close and also the numerical methods will always have a positive definite matrices.
</p>
<p>Here is an example using this idea for <code>RMprecip</code> and also some 
examples of building grids and evaluating the Tps results on them:
</p>
<pre>
# a useful function:
  dircos&lt;- function(x1){
             coslat1 &lt;- cos((x1[, 2] * pi)/180)
             sinlat1 &lt;- sin((x1[, 2] * pi)/180)
             coslon1 &lt;- cos((x1[, 1] * pi)/180)
             sinlon1 &lt;- sin((x1[, 1] * pi)/180)
             cbind(coslon1*coslat1, sinlon1*coslat1, sinlat1)}
# fit in 3-d to direction cosines
  out&lt;- Tps(dircos(RMprecip$x),RMprecip$y)
  xg&lt;-make.surface.grid(fields.x.to.grid(RMprecip$x))
  fhat&lt;- predict( out, dircos(xg))
# coerce to image format from prediction vector and grid points.
  out.p&lt;- as.surface( xg, fhat)
  surface( out.p)
# compare to the automatic
  out0&lt;- Tps(RMprecip$x,RMprecip$y, lon.lat=TRUE)
  surface(out0)
</pre>
<p>The function <code>fastTps</code> is really a convenient wrapper function that 
calls <code>mKrig</code> with the Wendland covariance function. This is 
experimental and some care needs to exercised in specifying the taper 
range and power ( <code>p</code>) which describes the polynomial behavior of 
the Wendland at the origin. Note that unlike Tps the locations are not 
scaled to unit range and this can cause havoc in smoothing problems with 
variables in very different units. So rescaling the locations <code> x&lt;- scale(x)</code> 
is a good idea for putting the variables on a common scale for smoothing.  
This function does have the potential to approximate estimates of Tps 
for very large spatial data sets. See <code>wendland.cov</code> and help on 
the SPAM package for more background.
Also, the function <code>predictSurface.fastTps</code> has been made more efficient for the 
case of k=2 and m=2. Also see the handy function <code><a href="mKrigMLE.html">fastTpsMLE</a></code> to estimate lambda by maximum likelihood. 
</p>
<p>See also the mKrig function for handling larger data sets and also for an example
of combining Tps and mKrig for evaluation on a huge grid. 
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of class Krig. This includes the 
fitted values, the predicted surface evaluated at the 
observation locations, and the residuals. The results of the grid 
search minimizing the generalized cross validation function are
returned in gcv.grid. Note that the GCV/REML optimization is 
done even if lambda or df is given. 
Please see the documentation on Krig for details of the returned 
arguments.
