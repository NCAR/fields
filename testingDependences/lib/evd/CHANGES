CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.2-1 ARE AS FOLLOWS

  Fitted objects now contain the variance covariance
  matrix, which can be accessed by the function vcov. 

  New function confint (methods confint.profile.evd and 
  confint.evd) for calculating Wald and profile 
  confidence intervals. The internal function pcint 
  has now been deleted, and plot.profile.evd no longer 
  returns profile confidence intervals invisibly. 

  The function amvnonpar now implements non-parametric
  estimators for dependence functions of extreme value 
  distributions of any dimension.

  The function amvevd now implements parametric 
  evaluation of dependence functions of logistic and
  asymmetric logistic models of any dimension.

  I have removed the bootstrap confidence intervals
  option from chiplot. This had problems with zero 
  empirical cdf estimates for some replications. A
  solution would be to use smoothed estimates, but I
  decided against implementing this.

  Argument trunc added to chiplot to control whether
  estimates are truncated at theoretical upper and
  lower bounds.

  The old interfaces to abvnonpar and amvnonpar have 
  been removed.

  I have included a CITATION file in the /inst directory
  so that typing citation("evd") returns an appropriate
  citation.

  The internal functions ccop and ccop.case have been
  converted into a new documented function ccbvevd.

  The recommended R package "stats" is now a required
  package for evd.

  The files INDEX and data/00Index are now unnecessary
  (the information is now automatically generated from
  documentation files) and have been removed.

  The defunct function abvpar has been removed.

CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.2-0 ARE AS FOLLOWS

  New function hbvevd for plotting the spectral density
  of bivariate extreme value models. The spectral density
  is also now plotted from plot.bvevd.

  Plotting diagnostics are now implemented for bivariate
  threshold methods using the method function plot.bvpot.

  The fbvpot function is now consistent with fbvevd;
  the dsm argument has been removed, and the 
  asymmetric mixed model has been added. Also, the
  Husler-Reiss model has been added for (undocumented) 
  Poisson process likelihood fitting.

  The new argument boot in the function chiplot allows
  bootstrap confidence intervals. The new argument
  spcase plots lines corresponding to special cases
  for comparison.

  The functions mrlplot and tcplot have a new argument 
  pscale allowing the x-axis to be the threshold
  exceedance probability rather than the threshold.

  The default plotting character in bivariate density 
  plots is now a circle, to be consistent with quantile
  curves plots. Also, all plotting functions now produce
  all available plots by default.

  The function tcplot has a new argument vci allowing
  control over the plotting style of the confidence
  intervals. Other arguments allow more control over
  labels and limits. 

  The clusters function with plot = TRUE would produce 
  an error if no data points were above the threshold. 
  This has been fixed.

  The demo soe9 has been expanded to include all of
  Chapter Nine of the text Statistics of Extremes.

CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.1-7 ARE AS FOLLOWS

  Added the asymmetric mixed bivariate model to the
  function fbvevd.

  A demo soe9 has been included, giving examples from
  Chapter Nine of the book statistics of extremes. An
  associated file demo.txt has been added to the /inst
  directory.
  
  The atvnonpar and atvpar functions have been renamed
  to amvnonpar and amvevd. The abvpar function has been
  renamed to abvevd, but the former still runs, with a
  warning.

  An argument rev has been added to abvpar and abvnonpar,
  allowing the evaluation of A(1-t) rather than A(t).
  It can also be passed from plot.bvevd.

  The argument epmar has been added to abvnonpar and 
  atvnonpar. It allows empirical estimation of the
  margins.

  The formerly internal function mtransform is now 
  documented. It transforms to and from exponential
  distributions under the gev model.

  The profile plots now plot profile log-likelihoods 
  rather than profile deviances.  
  
  The plotting functions plot.uvevd and plot.bvevd
  have an additional argument cilwd to control the
  line width of confidence intervals.

  The functions abvpar and abvnonpar now have default
  axes labels and a border line width argument.

  The function abvnonpar is simpler; the "tdo" method 
  is now undocumented, old methods "deheuvels" and 
  "halltajvidi" can now be implemented using the 
  argument madj. For back compatability, the old 
  interface can still be used. The weight function
  option for method "cfg" has been removed, and the
  "cfg" definition now has a simpler equivalent 
  representation. Similar changes have been made to
  atvnonpar (now renamed to amvnonpar).

  In fbvevd the dependence summaries, and hence the
  argument dsm, have been removed, though the former
  Dependence One value is now automatically given in
  the output. The argument warn.inf is now undocumented.
  
  The marginal option "exponential" to the function evmc
  has been changed to "rweibull" (negative exponential)
  because the former swaps the bivariate tails around.

  The function anova now has a logical argument half to
  deal with non-regular cases where the asymptotic
  distribution of the deviance difference is known to
  be one half of a chi-squared. Also, it no longer
  errors when testing bilog vs log or negbilog vs bilog.

  Added the dataset lossalae on general liability claims. 

CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.1-6 ARE AS FOLLOWS

  The exi function has been simplified; it now returns
  only a single estimate, but a new estimation method
  based on inter-exceedance times has been added. A new 
  function exiplot plots estimates of the extremal index.

  The rlow argument (lower clustering interval) is now
  hidden in the documentation for fpot, clusters, exi
  and exiplot.

  Due to numerical problems, the function rmvevd could 
  return Inf when the dependence parameters were small.
  This has been fixed. The maintainer thanks 
  Mohammed Mehdi Gholam Rezaee for reporting this. 
  
  The anova function errored when used inside another 
  function. This is now corrected. The maintainer thanks 
  William Valdar for reporting this. 

  In function abvnonpar the method "hall" is now 
  "halltajvidi", and an additional comment has been added
  to the help file, following a request from Nader Tajvidi.   

  Typographic sign error in User's Guide corrected.
  The maintainer thanks C L Wong for reporting this.   

  Spelling errors in uccle help file corrected. The
  maintainer thanks Tobias Verbeke for reporting
  this. Apologies to residents of Belgium! 

CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.1-5 ARE AS FOLLOWS

  The data passed to the bivariate fitting function
  fbvevd can now be a data frame with a third column 
  of mode logical. See the corresponding documentation 
  for more details.

  A new dataset called sealevel2 has been introduced.

CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.1-4 ARE AS FOLLOWS

  The lower.tail argument for pbvevd and pmvevd did not
  properly produce survivor functions when set to FALSE.
  This has been fixed. 

CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.1-3 ARE AS FOLLOWS

  A file was accidently included in Version 2.1-3 which
  meant that the package would not easily install under 
  C compilers other than gcc. This has been fixed.

CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.1-2 ARE AS FOLLOWS

  The function dextreme errored when the argument
  largest was FALSE. This has been fixed. The
  maintainer thanks Brian Tolley for reporting this.

CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.1-1 ARE AS FOLLOWS
  
  The function fbvevd now has arguments cshape, cscale
  and cloc for fitting common marginal parameters.

  The function fbvpot now has arguments cshape and 
  cscale for fitting common marginal parameters.

  The Husler-Reiss model is now implemented in fbvpot.

  New function chiplot for plotting estimates of the 
  dependence measures chi and chi-bar for bivariate 
  data.
   
  The latex file for The Users' Guide is now included
  in the doc directory along with the pdf file.

  The default x-label "theshold" in mrlplot has been
  corrected to "threshold". 

CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.1-0 ARE AS FOLLOWS

  New function fbvpot for fitting bivariate threshold
  models. A plot method for these models will be 
  implemented at a later date.

  New argument sym in function fbvevd, to allow the
  fitting of dependence structures under a symmetry
  constraint. The argument also exists in the new
  function fbvpot. 

CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.0-1 ARE AS FOLLOWS

  Univariate threshold models are now implemented. The main
  new function is fpot, which calculates maximum likelihood
  estimates under the generalized Pareto and point process
  representations.

  Density, distribution, quantile and simulation functions
  for the generalized Pareto distribution have been added.

  The new function clusters identifies extreme clusters. A
  related function exi calculates estimates of a quantity
  known as the extremal index.
  
  The new plotting functions mrlplot and tcplot aid
  threshold selection.

  The class structure has changed slightly.
  Models fitted using fextreme and forder still have class
  c("extreme", "evd"). Models fitted using fbvevd still have 
  class c("bvevd", "evd"). Models fitted using the new 
  function fpot have class c("pot", "uvevd", "evd").  Models 
  fitted using fgev now have class c("gev", "uvevd", "evd").

  The method function plot.gev is now plot.uvevd. This 
  operates on both the gev and pot classes, due to the new 
  class structure.

  The defunct functions fgumbel, frweibull, ffrechet (each
  defunct since version 1.2-0) and fbvall (defunct since 
  version 2.0-0) have been removed.

CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.0-0 ARE AS FOLLOWS

  Internal change to avoid warnings under R version 1.7.0 when
  calling the multivariate asymmetric logistic distribution,
  density, quantile and generation functions.

  The tests directory has been removed.

  The function evmc unintentionally reversed asymmetric 
  dependence structures. This has been fixed. The
  maintainer thanks Chris Ferro for reporting this. 

CHANGES FROM VERSION 1.2-3 ARE AS FOLLOWS

  The function fgev.quantile is now internal; the functionality
  has been absorbed into fgev.

  It is now possible to parameterize gev model fits using the
  endpoint of the distribution by setting prob to zero or one 
  in fgev.

  New functions for generating stochastic processes associated
  with extreme value theory. marma, mar and mma generate max 
  autoregressive moving average processes. evmc generates first 
  order Markov chains with bivariate extreme value dependence 
  structures.

  The functions fbvlog, fbvalog, etc are now internal. The new 
  function fbvevd should be used for the fitting of all bivariate
  models.

  The rbvevd, dbvevd and pbvevd functions replace individual 
  functions for bivariate models. Similarly, rmvevd and dmvevd 
  functions replace individual functions for multivariate models. 

  The function abvpar replaces individual functions for 
  plotting and calculating the dependence functions of 
  parametric bivariate models. 

  New functions atvnonpar and atvpar, which calculate and plot 
  dependence functions of trivariate extreme value distributions,
  using non-parametric estimates and parametric models (at given 
  parameter values).

  Fitted bivariate models (i.e. objects of class bvevd) now 
  include Akaike's Information Criterion and, optionally, 
  various dependence structure summaries. The argument dsm
  controls this option. 

  New lower.tail argument in bivariate and multivariate 
  distribution functions.

  The function pcint is now internal. Profile confidence intervals 
  are now invisibly returned from plot.profile.evd. Also, the
  argument ci of plot.profile.evd can now be a vector.

  Functions called from plot.evd (dens, pp, qq, rl) and plot.bvevd
  (bvdens, bvdp, bvcpp) are now internal.

  The default labelling of the x-axis for the return level plot 
  has been changed from the technically correct 
  "-1/log(1-1/Return Period)" to the more widely used 
  "Return Period".

  There now exists a density function for the multivariate asymmetric 
  logistic model. The density function can be calculated by calling 
  dmvevd with model = "alog".
  
  The argument mar of rmvevd, pmvevd and dmvevd can now be a list
  with d elements, where d is the dimension of the distribution.

  An extraction function logLik.evd has been added so that the 
  function AIC.default in R base can be used.

  The function profile2d.evd has a new method argument (to be
  consistent with profile.evd) and new arguments xaxs and
  yaxs (to override the default behaviour of the function image).

  The function plot.bvevd has new arguments blty (border 
  line type) and grid.

  In the function abvnonpar the logical argument convex replaces 
  the numeric argument modify.
  
  The functions fext, rext, etc are now called fextreme, 
  rextreme, etc.

  The objects formery of class "evd" are now of class 
  c("gev","evd") or c("extreme","evd"). The plot.evd function 
  is now plot.gev.

  The row names of all data.frame datasets are now the years of
  observation. Furthermore, the period of observation for the 
  venice data has been corrected in the help file.

  The arguments mesh and conf in profile.evd now work as 
  documented.
 
  The fbvall function is defunct.
  
  New datasets: failure, fox, lisbon, ocmulgee, oldage, sask  
  and uccle. 
  
  The CHANGES file has been moved to the top-level directory.


CHANGES FROM VERSION 1.2-2 ARE AS FOLLOWS

  Two more datasets - venice and portpirie, intended for use
  in the evdbayes package.

  Fixed minor problem with extraction functions for bvall objects
  when only one model is fitted.

  Contours for bivariate density plots are now chosen by 
  the contour function.

  Error messages in internal functions are more informative.


CHANGES FROM VERSION 1.2-1 ARE AS FOLLOWS

  New methods hall and tdo for calculating non-parametric 
  dependence function estimates.

  BUG fix: the non-parameteric dependence function estimator of 
  Caperaa et al (the default) was plotting/calculating A(1-x) 
  rather than A(x).

  The recommended citation for the package is now the article
  included in R-News Volume 2/2.

  Extra graphical arguments have been included in the abv[...]
  functions. 


CHANGES FROM VERSION 1.2-0 ARE AS FOLLOWS

  The profile.evd function now has a method argument to specify 
  the optimization method. The default method is now BFGS.
  
  A BUG existed in profile.evd; a fatal error would result if 
  the mesh argument did not have a names attribute. This has 
  been fixed.

  Internal: General code cleaning/optimizing. New internal 
  functions have been created.


CHANGES FROM VERSION 1.1-0 ARE AS FOLLOWS

  Class orientated objects have been introduced, including print
  methods and extraction functions.
  
  Diagnostics plots can be implemented using plot, or the lower
  level functions dens, rl, pp, qq (univariate) and bvdens, bvcpp,
  bvdp (bivariate).

  Parameters can be profiled using the functions profile and 
  profile2d. Profile deviance surfaces can be plotted using plot.
  Profile confidence intervals can be calculated using pcint.

  Fitted models can be compared using the function anova.

  New function fgev.quantile to fit the GEV distribution, 
  re-parameterizing using a quantile. This allows profile 
  deviances of extreme quantiles to be plotted.

  Extra argument corr for fitting functions.
  If corr is TRUE the correlation matrix is calculated.
  By default corr is FALSE.

  Extra argument warn.inf for fitting functions.
  When warn.inf is TRUE (the default) a warning is given if the 
  negative log-likelihood is infinite at the starting values.

  The ffrechet, fgumbel and frweibull functions are defunct.

  Internal: Function ccop for calculating conditional copulas.


CHANGES FROM VERSION 1.0-0 ARE AS FOLLOWS

  Automated starting values for fitting functions.

  Compiled code is now used within the bivariate fitting routines
  and all bivariate simulation functions.
  They are consequently much faster than those in Version 1.0-0.

  Simulation, distribution, density and fitting functions for the
  bivariate bilogistic, bivariate negative bilogistic and
  bivariate Coles-Tawn models.

  A new function fbvall which fits all bivariate models 
  simultaneously.
  For every model it returns maximum likelihood estimates, standard
  errors, criteria for model comparisons based on the deviance
  (e.g. AIC), and summaries of the dependence structure (see the 
  help file for details).

  A new function abvnonpar which calculates or plots non-parametric
  estimates of the dependence function.

  All functions explicitly allow for missing values.
  This includes bivariate fitting functions, where missing values can
  occur on either or both margins within any observation. 

  Extra argument nsloc for univariate fitting functions,
  and arguments nsloc1 and nsloc2 for bivariate fitting functions.
  These allow non-stationary fitting using linear models for the
  location parameters.

  Extra argument std.err for fitting functions.
  If std.err is FALSE the standard errors are not calculated.
  By default std.err is TRUE.

  Extra argument method for fitting functions.
  The method argument explicitly specifies the optimization method 
  to be passed to the function optim.
  The default method is now BFGS for all fitting functions except 
  fext and forder, where the default method is still Nelder-Mead.
   
  The sealevel data frame has been expanded to include observations 
  from 1912 to 1992. There are 39 missing values.  
   
  Explicit error handling in fitting functions when the observed
  information matrix is singular.  
  
  Artificial constraints are now placed on dependence parameters 
  within bivariate fitting functions to prevent numerical problems.  

  The asy argument for the bivariate asymmetric logistic and 
  bivariate asymmetric negative logistic models now defaults to
  c(1,1).

  The default values of the marginal parameters for the bivariate and
  multivariate functions in Version 1.0-0 are different.
  This is counter intuitive, so the default value for each margin
  within the multivariate functions is now c(0,1,0) (Gumbel), which 
  is consistent with the functions for bivariate models.

  The bivariate density functions contained a fairly minor BUG; if one
  of the marginal parameter arguments were passed a three column
  matrix and some of the rows of the matrix produced zero density, a
  fatal error would result. This has now been fixed.

  Internal: The .C interface is called with PACKAGE = "evd".

  Internal: R_alloc replaces malloc in C routines.
